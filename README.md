# Bee Hive Simulation Software
My original dissertation project. A simulation software designed to replicate the every day activities of a European bee hive.  
We then added the ability for individual bees to be either greedy or lazy (or both) and saw what effect it had on both the individual bees in the hive and on the hive as a whole.
