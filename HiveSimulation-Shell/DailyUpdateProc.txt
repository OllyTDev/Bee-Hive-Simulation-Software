Set everything back to 0 for the start of a new day ie
AdultWorkersDeaths = 0;

if ( quantityMyl < CROPVOLUME * SQUADRON_SIZE and amountPollen_g < POLLENLOAD * SQUADRON_SIZE)
//if the squadron can handle the number of flowers and pollen load

//check if the hive is dead
if HoneyEnergyStore < 0
   [
     if ColonyDied = false
     [
       cout << "Starvation! Colony died on Day " + ticks;
     ]
     set ColonyDied true
   ]
if (ticks > 1) and (TotalWorkerAndDroneBrood + TotalIHbees + TotalForagers = 0)
 [
   if ColonyDied = false
   [
     cout << "No bees left! Colony died on Day " + ticks;
   ]
   set ColonyDied true
 ]

Can set other things here but otherwise that's it.
